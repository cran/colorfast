Description: Color values in R are often represented as strings of hexadecimal
    colors or named colors.  This package offers fast conversion of 
    these color representations to either an array of red/green/blue/alpha values
    or to the packed integer format used in native raster objects.  This fast conversion
    of colors is implemented using an order-preserving minimal perfect hash
    derived from Majewski et al (1996) 'A Family of Perfect Hashing Methods'
